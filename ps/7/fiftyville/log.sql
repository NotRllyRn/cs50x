-- i just did check50 and it said i solved the mystery wrong
-- i think that it might be bruce because now that i think of it, raymond said the theif left within 10 minutes, not after 10 minutes
-- Bruce left 3 minutes after the theft and also called robin for less than a minute

-- so i think the theif is bruce and the acomplice is robin

-- I GOT IT RIGHT! :)
